This Lab is making a GUI of making a list of people with their information. The functions are making a new form, saving the form,
resetting the form, import files, and export files. The user enters the information in each text boxes and provides the signature when
the user wants to add new people in the list. This also allows users to change the information and saves the changes. There is a drop box
for user to use for selecting the existed people.

There are seven panels. Each panel has its own functionality. First one is the drop box for the listing people. Second panel is for filling
in the data. The left side is for labeling which data filling in which text field and right side is for entering data. Then,
